            Vincent van Gogh's swirling sky pulls you in instantly. Gogh's post-impressionist masterpiece captures emotional turbulence through vivid brushwork and color.
            Few people know that this famous painting was created in Saint-Paul Asylum after the artist suffered a mental break.

            Vermeer's painting, often called the "Mona Lisa of the North", draws you in with the subjectâ€™s mysterious gaze and iconic earring.
            This painting is referred to as a tronie, meaning it's not a portrait, rather a character.

            Monetâ€™s peaceful pond painting gently closes the visual journey, emphasizing reflection, stillness, and color harmony.
            Water lillies is actually a collection of paintings by Monet, not just a single painting.
